# SPECTRUM_SHARING_USING_FDERATED_LEARING

Spectrum underutilization is a problem in wireless communication systems. Federated learning can be used to overcome this problem by achieving data privacy and reducing communication costs. Developed an algorithm using Federated learning where we trained the data by only sending the gradient and not the entire data to the server. By doing this we achieved the following, 
• Globalised model 
• Privacy of data 
• Low cost of communication And hence we shared the information of under-utilised spectrums between parties.
